# Explore-Shape
This is an experimental website exploring shapes using AI. 

I'm exploring how AI can help create and play with geometric shapes in fun and creative ways.
Through this web project, I combine animations, poetry, stories—including biblical themes—and other activities that all relate back to shapes.

It's about how shapes influence our thinking, spark curiosity, and inspire ingenuity.
Most of all, it's about using AI as a tool to bring creative ideas to life.
